# iOS App: Scheduler
## Motivation
Although there are many similar apps available on the App Store now, based on our experience, these apps are sometimes too ‘powerful’ that are not very user friendly or they are dedicated to a monotonous functionality (although they are very good) that we have to install multiple apps in order to acquire all the functions we are looking for. Therefore, we wish to build one app that balance complexity and functionality, including the best features that can promote productivity. After refining and improving our app by refining the key features, improving our user interface and the overall flow, we have finally created an app that has some compelling features compared with other similar management and productivity apps. 

## Key features of our app
The Scheduler app integrates the functionality of self-control, simple event scheduling, daily activity planning and reminders to give users a simple yet efficient way to manage their schedule. To be brief, we have a scheduler view to schedule important events and present in sorted order, a to do list associated with each planned task in the scheduler, a daily planner to manage daily plans and scheduler, and a timer that help user to stay away from their phone and stay focus to a task.

## Further improvement 
We need to collect as much feedback as we can to continue refining our app. Meanwhile, we will also be checking app’s performance and keep optimizing it. Loading a pre-upload events by fetching and comparing geo-location is also a cool feature that we wish to continue working on, and we wish to turn what we hardcoded now into a true functionality of our app.
